WARHAMMER FANTASY ROLEPLAY
2ND EDITION

Character Tool by Justin Ray

This tool is used for character creation in WFRP 2e. Currently the only features that work are a character creation script which will walk you through the racial features of your character. No support is currently avaialble for the Career aspect, you will have to add that manually.

The character viewer option does not work, but the Skill and Talent Viewer option does.

The Wood Elf option is taken from the fan made Defenders of the Forest splatbook. The High Elf option has been given a few extra skills to make it a bit more viable. Dwarf, Human, and Halflings are largely unchanged.

There is currently no planned release date for further features, though additional features would be saving characterse to a database for recall, adding Career, armor, and weapon details, etc.

PLEASE NOTE: You must follow the instructions exactly. If it tells you to enter a number but you enter a word, it will not accept your input. Eventually I will update this, but for now you must suffer my bad coding. This is the first 'major' script I wrote and while I am very proud of it for what it is, it leaves much to be desired.
